# Sorting Visualizer

A dynamic visual representation of popular sorting algorithms built using Python, Pygame, and Tkinter. This project allows users to visualize how different sorting algorithms work in real time with an interactive interface.

## Features
- **Sorting Algorithms**:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
- Interactive GUI for selecting:
  - Array size
  - Sorting algorithm
  - Visualization speed
  - Grid lines toggle
- Real-time animations of the sorting process.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language
- **Pygame**: For visualizing the sorting process
- **Tkinter**: For creating an interactive GUI

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nidhi-dwivedi/Sorting-Visualizer.git
   ```

2.Navigate to the project directory:
  ```bash
cd SortingVisualizer
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

4. Run the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Controls
# Use the Tkinter interface to:
- Set the array size.
- Choose the sorting algorithm.
- Adjust the visualization speed.
- Toggle grid lines on/off.
# Click the "Start" button to begin the visualization.
# Click the "Quit" button to exit.

## File Structure
- main.py: The main entry point that handles the GUI and sorting logic.
- screen.py: Contains the ScreenVisual class for rendering the visualization using Pygame.
- settings.py: Stores constants like colors, screen dimensions, and FPS.
